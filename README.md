# hello-world
this repository is for my codeyou pre work for learning how to use github
My name is Cody Hofmans and I am a 26 year old male from Louisville Kentucky. In my free time I love to make music, play video games, cook, read, fish, and camp/hike. I have 3 pets at home: a dog named Sado, a cat named Izzy, and a green cheek conure named Mochi. My favorite band is the Beatles and my favorite video game (at least right now) is Stardew Valley. Currently my girlfirend and I are trying to cook every recipe in the official Stardew Valley cookbook!
